# patchplot

#### Introduction

Default subplot techniques of matplolib are not useful to make complicated layout figure. In particular, To align different size figures is really difficult and often make interference between the figures. Using GridSpec in matplotlib.gridspec is one of the solutions for the above problem. However, the method requires us to prepare the figure's layout in advance. On the other hands, the recent fashion of data visualization in python is the interactive process using Jupyter notebook. Users can check the output for each cell and change it. The methods using GridSpec goes against the fashion. Therefore, I made a new python module that enables us to patch the matplotlib plots easily, interactively and precisely.
